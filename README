# Smart Object Cropper 

An AI-powered web application that automatically detects and crops the primary object (like faces over hands) from images using TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD.

## Features 

- **Smart Object Detection**: Uses TensorFlow.js with COCO-SSD model
- **Primary Object Selection**: Prioritizes faces/people over other objects
- **Precise Cropping**: Accurately crops the detected object
- **Visual Debugging**: Shows detection scores and selection criteria
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works 

1. Upload an image containing objects
2. AI detects all objects using COCO-SSD model
3. Smart algorithm selects the most important object based on:
   - Object class (prioritizes faces/people)
   - Detection confidence
   - Size and position in the frame
4. Crops and displays the selected object
